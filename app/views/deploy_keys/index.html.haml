  Deploy keys allow read-only access to repository. They can be used for for CI, staging or production servers. A deploy key can be added to only one project. If you need to add the same key to multiple projects you can create a deploy user and add that user to multiple projects.

  - if can? current_user, :admin_project, @project
    = link_to new_project_deploy_key_path(@project), class: "btn btn-small", title: "New Deploy Key" do
      Add Deploy Key
- if @keys.any?
  %table
    %thead
      %tr
        %th Keys
        %th
        %th
    - @keys.each do |key|
      = render(partial: 'show', locals: {key: key})
