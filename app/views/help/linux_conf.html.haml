        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:arnd-arndnet/git

  %li
    %p
      Install git and git-flow (use only one of the options)
    .bash
      %pre 
        sudo aptitude install git git-flow
    .bash
      %pre 
        sudo apt-get install git git-flow

  %li

      Configure your git environment user data
    
    .bash
      %pre 
        - setup_str = ["git config --global user.name \"#{current_user.name}\"", "git config --global user.email \"#{current_user.email}\""].join("\n")
        #{setup_str}

  %li
    %p
      %b OPTIONAL.
      Add some alias to the most used commands
    
    .bash
      %pre 
        git config --global alias.st status
        git config --global alias.co checkout
        git config --global alias.br branch
        git config --global alias.ci commit

  %li
    %p
      %b RECOMMENDED.
      When you are working with git using the linux terminal, it's very useful to know in which branch you really are. Add the content of
      %a{:title=>".bashrc example file", :href=>"https://agostini.tlmat.unican.es/uploads/.bashrc"} this file
      to your ~/.bashrc. This will also change the colors of your prompt, so if you are unhappy with them feel free to modify anything.

  %li
    %p
      %b OPTIONAL.
      Set the default editor for git (in this case Vim)
    
    .bash
      %pre 
        git config --global core.editor vim

  %li
    %p
      %b RECOMMENDED.
      If you want, you can install a GUI for managing a repository, and there are plenty of them for Linux, as well as for Windows and MacOS X. Our recomendation is to use
      %a{:title=>"Git Client - SmartGit", :href=>"http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/index.html"} SmartGit
      client. Its main advantage is that it is based on Java, so is compatible with Linux, Windows and MacOS X (as well as any OS with a JVM). It also has a free license for personal use.

  %li
    %p
      If you don't have one yet, generate your SSH key (DSA or RSA, we use the first one as example).

    .bash
      %pre 
        ssh-keygen -t dsa

  %li
    %p
      %a{:title=>"Add new SSH key", :href=>"https://agostini.tlmat.unican.es/keys/new"} Add
      the content of your public key (probably in ~/.ssh folder). You can add as many keys as you want for different machines or even use the same one for all of them.

  %li
    %p
      %b OPTIONAL.
      If you want, you can add an avatar (an image) to your account and it will be used across this site instead of the generic auto-generated one. In order to do so, you need to 
      %a{:title=>"Gravatar - Globally Recognized Avatars", :href=>"https://es.gravatar.com/"} create an account in Gravatar
      and associate the avatar with your email address.
